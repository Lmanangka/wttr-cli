# wttr-cli

wttr-cli is a CLI app to check the weather outside, its feature include:
current weather, 3 days weather forecast with 3 hours intervals and user's
preferred language. This project is a part of My learning journey to make
something with code and to understanding how to use API, retrieve a data from
API, processing the data and how to make it presentable to a user

## Usage
